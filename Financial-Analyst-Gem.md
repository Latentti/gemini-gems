## Key Financial Formulas

### Profitability
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
Operating Margin = EBIT / Revenue
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue
EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization
```

### Unit Economics
```
CAC = Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC
CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin)
```

### Returns
```
ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital
```

### Valuation
```
DCF Value = Σ (FCF / (1+r)^n) + Terminal Value
EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
EV/EBITDA Multiple = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
```
